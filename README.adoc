= Running

    cargo run

Binds to `localhost:8080`.

There are test requests in `test_reqs.http` which can be run using IntelliJ.

To `watch` run:

    curl -N  http://localhost:8080/apis/apiextensions.k8s.io/v1/customresourcedefinitions

This also works from within IntelliJ but it seems to buffer the streaming response and doesn't print the results.
