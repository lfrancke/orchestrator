= Stackable Orchestrator

**This project is highly experimental and unstable**

The Stackable Orchestrator is an implementation of a very limited subset of the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/[`kube-apiserver` API].
The major difference (apart from all the missing functionality) is that this Orchestrator _only_ supports custom resources.

At the moment `CustomResourceDefinition` is the only built-in resource.
All others have to be added as `CRD`s.

The goal is to be able to use _kubectl_ to talk to this Orchestrator.

== Setup

The Orchestrator currently stores its data in a SQLite database which needs to be created first using the `db/create_db.sh` script.
It does not take any parameters and creates an `orchestrator.db` file in the main directory.


== Running

    cargo run

Binds to `localhost:8080` by default and can (currently) not be overridden.
